# PROJECT - Source and Channel Coding

## Huffman-Encoding
- Constructed a Huffman code for each of the probability distributions obtained from the frequency tables.
 
## Encode data: 
- Using the Huffman Algorithm encoded the source fileâ€™s contents into another file. Displayed the size of the encoded file.

## Decode Data: 
- From the encoded file, decoded the original source file by extracting the symbols from the
codewords. 
- Checked the decoded output with the original file (via a code snippet) and ensured there is no error in
decoding.
